### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is bitraxis and im a very lame coder.

### Im gonna try to make some projects mainly in java and c, c#, c++, and i also try to make my own compilers.

!IM A LINUX CODER SO IF I SOMETIMES DONT UPLOAD CROSS PLATFORM THINGS JUST IGNORE BUT I ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE THINGS CROSS PLATFORM!

/ Pronouns : He/Him


? Why Bitraxis? Bitraxis is a old nickname that i use it means "Bit rotated in a axis" my even older name was BitraxisZ as it meant "Bit rotated in a axis of Z" ?

That's it folks!!!!!
